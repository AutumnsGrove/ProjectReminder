- [ ] Research small LLMs (Llama 3.2 1B, Phi-3 Mini)
- [ ] Evaluate performance on target hardware
- [ ] Choose final stack

### STT Integration

- [ ] Add voice recording endpoint (`POST /api/voice/transcribe`)
- [ ] Test transcription accuracy

### NLP Parsing
- [ ] Install and configure chosen LLM
- [ ] Create prompt for reminder parsing
- [ ] Implement parsing pipeline (text → structured data)
- [ ] Add fallback to manual edit if parse fails

### UI Integration
- [ ] Add voice button (🎤) to edit form

- [ ] Display transcription before saving
- [ ] Handle parsing errors gracefully

**Example Interactions:**
```
"Remind me to call mom tomorrow at 3pm"
→ {text: "Call mom", due_date: "2025-11-04", due_time: "15:00"}

"Buy groceries when I'm at Kroger"
→ {text: "Buy groceries", location_text: "Kroger"}

"Important: Submit report by Friday 5pm"
→ {text: "Submit report", due_date: "2025-11-08", due_time: "17:00", priority: "important"}

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Voice input creates correct reminders (>90% accuracy)
- ✅ Runs locally (privacy preserved)
- ✅ Fast enough (<5 seconds end-to-end)
