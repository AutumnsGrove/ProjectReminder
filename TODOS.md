## Phase 8: Voice Input (MVP - Voice-to-Text Only) ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ Complete (November 3, 2025)
**Implementation Time**: ~5-6 hours (8 subagents)
**Documentation**: See `docs/phase8_completion.md` for full details

**Tech Stack:**
- ✅ STT: Whisper.cpp (local, offline, base.en model)
- ✅ LLM: Llama 3.2 1B (deferred to Phase 8.1)

**MVP Scope:** Voice transcription only (manual field completion)
**Architecture:** See `docs/phase8_architecture.md` for full plan

### Research & Selection ✅
- [x] Research local STT options (Whisper.cpp chosen)
- [x] Research small LLMs (Llama 3.2 1B chosen, deferred)
- [x] Architecture plan created with house-planner
- [x] Choose final stack (Whisper.cpp for MVP)

### Whisper.cpp Integration ✅
- [x] Install and configure Whisper.cpp (base.en model, 23x realtime)
- [x] Create Python wrapper for Whisper.cpp (`server/voice/whisper.py`)
- [x] Add voice recording endpoint (`POST /api/voice/transcribe`)
- [x] Test transcription accuracy (85-90% for clear speech)

### UI Integration ✅
- [x] Add voice button (🎤) to edit form with 3 states (idle/recording/processing)
- [x] Implement audio recording in browser (`public/js/voice-recorder.js`)
- [x] Send audio to backend for transcription (FormData multipart)
- [x] Display transcription in text field (auto-populate)
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling (permissions, failures, toast notifications)

### Backend Integration ✅

- [x] Cloudflare Workers endpoint: `POST /api/voice/transcribe` (501 Not Implemented)
- [x] VoiceTranscriptionResponse model (text, model, language, file_size)
- [x] Comprehensive error codes (400, 413, 422, 500, 503, 504)

### Testing & Documentation ✅
- [x] 14 pytest tests (100% pass, 97% endpoint coverage)
- [x] Requirements document (`docs/phase8_requirements.md`)
- [x] Technical research (`docs/phase8_technical_research.md`)
- [x] Completion report (`docs/phase8_completion.md`)

**Phase 8 MVP Success Criteria (All Met):**
- ✅ Voice transcription to text (85-90% accuracy achieved)
- ✅ Runs locally (privacy preserved, offline-first)
- ✅ Fast enough (2-8 seconds end-to-end, 23x realtime processing)
- ✅ User manually fills date, time, priority (as expected)
- ✅ Graceful error handling (browser permissions, network, transcription)

**User Flow:**
1. Click 🎤 button → Browser requests permission
2. User speaks: "Buy groceries at Kroger tomorrow"
3. Recording stops (manual or auto 30s)
4. Audio uploads → Whisper.cpp transcribes (2-8s)
5. Text appears: "Buy groceries at Kroger tomorrow"
6. User manually sets date, priority, location

## Phase 8.1: LLM Parsing (Natural Language Understanding) 📅 NEXT

**Goal**: Auto-extract reminder metadata from transcribed text using local LLM.

**Example**:
- **Voice**: "Call mom about Thanksgiving tomorrow at 3pm, this is urgent"
- **Phase 8 Output**: Text: "Call mom about Thanksgiving tomorrow at 3pm, this is urgent"
- **Phase 8.1 Output**:
  - Text: "Call mom about Thanksgiving"
  - Due Date: 2025-11-04 (parsed "tomorrow")
  - Due Time: 15:00:00 (parsed "3pm")
  - Priority: urgent (parsed "this is urgent")
  - Category: Calls (inferred from "call")
  - Time Required: false

**Tech Stack:**
- Llama 3.2 1B or Phi-3 Mini (local inference)
- llama.cpp or llama-cpp-python
- Custom system prompt for reminder parsing
- New endpoint: `POST /api/voice/parse`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install and configure Llama 3.2 1B
- [ ] Create prompt for reminder parsing
- [ ] Implement parsing pipeline (text → structured data)
- [ ] Add fallback to manual edit if parse fails
- [ ] Add `POST /api/voice/parse` endpoint
- [ ] Test with various natural language inputs

**Phase 8.1 Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Auto-extract date: "tomorrow" → "2025-11-04"
- ✅ Auto-extract time: "at 3pm" → "15:00:00"
- ✅ Auto-extract priority: "urgent" → "urgent"
- ✅ Auto-extract location: "at Kroger" → geocoded
- ✅ Auto-extract category: "call" → "Calls"

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours (5-6 subagents)
