CONVERSION STATS:
- Format: M4A -> WAV (PCM 16-bit, 16kHz)
- Input directory: EXAMPLE_RECORDINGS/
- Output directory: audio_converted/wav/
- Files converted: 25/25 (100%)

TRANSCRIPTION STATS:
- Model: Whisper.cpp Base (English)
- Threads: 4
- Timestamps: Disabled
- Files transcribed: 25/25 (100%)
- Total processing time: 8 seconds

AUDIO FILE CHARACTERISTICS:
These are voice reminders demonstrating various reminder types:
- Time-based: "Call Mom tomorrow at 3 p.m."
- Location-based: "Remind me to get paint when I'm at Home Depot"
- Recurring: "Take vitamins daily at 9 in the morning"
- Priority levels: Ranging from casual to urgent
- Duration: Varied length messages (simple to complex)

TRANSCRIPTION QUALITY:
- High accuracy: Short prompts transcribed clearly
- Complex sentences: Longer messages captured with good detail
- Special cases: Numbers, locations, and time expressions handled well
- Minor corrections needed in 2-3 files (e.g., "Bye" should be "Buy" in #6, #24)

OUTPUT FILES:
- Individual transcriptions: transcriptions/test_1.txt through test_25.txt
- Combined file: transcriptions/all_transcriptions.txt (2.3 KB)
- WAV files: audio_converted/wav/ (25 files)

KEY FINDINGS:
The transcription demonstrates Whisper.cpp capability to:
1. Parse natural voice input accurately
2. Handle various reminder types (time, location, recurring)
3. Capture priority indicators ("urgent", "important", "super urgent")
4. Process longer, more complex messages effectively

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review transcriptions/test_*.txt files for quality
2. Parse transcriptions for:
   - Time expressions (tomorrow, Monday, 3 p.m., etc.)
   - Location mentions (Home Depot, Whole Foods, Apple Store, etc.)
   - Priority keywords (urgent, important, etc.)
   - Recurring patterns (daily, every Monday, etc.)
3. Integrate with NLP pipeline for reminder creation
4. Test timezone and location parsing
